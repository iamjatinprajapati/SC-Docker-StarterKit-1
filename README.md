# Sitecore Docker Starter Kit

## The Dream

This step is a small step towards a bigger dream, of helping the community out with a Starter Kit, to start of Sitecore Projects, with a Single Docker Starterkit.
As an initial step, we have considered only a few modules linked to it, but the final achievement will be to get all those modules which can be considered as must haves, are integrated into the Starterkit, for all the Sitecore Versions, starting 10.1 and as Developers, we just get to pick and choose what to install and what to not. And once the things are chosen, all those things are available to us -- configured and set for all of us to get started on this.

This Dream and now the goal is of two people - [Jatin Prajapati](https://twitter.com/jatin_praj) and [Varun Shringarpure](https://twitter.com/varunvns) who are the initial contributors of this Starterkit. And we welcome anyone to join us in this noble cause, of making the life of any other Sitecore Developer better.

So lets get started!

## Challenge

Well, when Jatin and I started off on a Journey on Sitecore with Container and Docker - right when Sitecore 10.0 was launched, we noticed that there was a huge learning curve, for a Sitecore Developer who starts on to the Container and Docker path. There were things to get started from some front runners of Sitecore team as well as some community members, but, when we looked at actual project implementations, there was still lot of ground to cover.
As both of us were new to a lot of things, spent a lot of hours learning through a number of things and getting through to a place where we felt comfortable with Sitecore running successfully on Docker - whether its XP0 or XP Scaled and hence we thought, of making an effort to reduce this pain, for our dear community members of Sitecore - that in the long run, it is easy for everyone to move ahead and configure their Visual Studio Solution as well as the required configuration for their Sitecore using the Docker files and configuration available simply by a method of pick and choose.

We have made a concious effort to make the life easy and we have also got this checked from some developers who also faced the challenges during their journey and they have felt that their effort is substancially reduced using this kit. This also tells us, that our effort is going in the right direction. But, we are also looking for inputs as well as contributions and the more inputs and contributions we get the better this kit will be at the end of the day.

Some inspiration also comes from a starter kit which was available during the Sitecore Hackathon 2021 and we are very thankful - because we took some ideas from it and it made our initial part easy.
